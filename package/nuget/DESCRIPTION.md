CopperSpice is a set of individual libraries which can be used to develop cross platform software
applications in C++. It is a totally open source project released under the LGPL V2.1 license and was
initially derived from the Qt framework. Over the last several years CopperSpice has completely diverged,
with a goal of providing a first class GUI library to unite the C++ community.
