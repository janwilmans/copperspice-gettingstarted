## CopperSpice

### Introduction

CopperSpice is a set of individual libraries which can be used to develop cross platform software applications in C++.
It is a true open source project released under the LGPL V2.1 license and was initially derived from the Qt framework.

CopperSpice has diverged to become a modern representation of what can be accomplished with C++. Our goal and intention
is to provide a first class GUI library to unite the C++ community.

Our motivation for developing CopperSpice was to change the fundamental design and turn the existing framework into a
set of libraries for C++ developers. We are accomplishing this by leveraging modern C++ functionality, new technology,
and modern tooling.

The libraries available in CopperSpice include:

- CsCore
- CsGui
- CsMultimedia
- CsNetwork
- CsOpenGL
- CsSql
- CsSvg
- CsVulkan
- CsWebKit
- CsXml
- CsXmlPatterns

There are also several open source BSD licensed libraries which are used by CopperSpice and available as stand
alone libraries for anyone developing C++ applications.

- CsCrypto
- CsLibGuarded
- CsPaint
- CsPointer
- CsSignal
- CsString
